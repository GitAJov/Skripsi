{"id": 2, "query": "What city was the primary capital of the Confederate States of America?", "response": " The primary capital of the Confederate States of America (CSA) during the American Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865, was Richmond, Virginia. Established as a federal district in 1742 by the British colonizers and officially incorporated into a city in 1747, the original name for the city of Richmond was \"Richmond Town\" or simply \"Town\". The capital moved between locations until finally settling on Columbia in South Carolina, which held this title briefly from 1860 to 1862.\n\nAs tensions continued to escalate over the issue of slavery and states' rights in the United States, Virginia decided that they would leave the Union in order to maintain their constitutional right to uphold state sovereignty. This decision was announced on April 17th, 1861, by Governor John Letcher, who declared his intention for seceding from the U.S., following which he issued a call for volunteers and soldiers to join the Confederate Army under President Jefferson Davis' leadership.\n\nOn May 20th, Richmond officially became the capital of this newly formed nation—the Confederacy. This was due largely in part because its strategic location made it easily defensible against any potential attacks from the Union Navy while also providing an advantageous position as a transport hub for military resources and manpower, particularly within the Appalachian region which had been declared under martial law by Confederate General Robert E. Lee earlier that year (April 20th).\n\nThe city's role in the Confederacy was significant, both militarily and politically. Richmond served as headquarters for the government of CSA President Jefferson Davis and his cabinet members while they oversaw military affairs and made decisions on how best to respond to Union actions within the United States during this period of civil unrest. Among these key figures were Vice Presidents Alexander H. Stephens from Georgia; Stephen R. Mallory, Secretary of Navy (and later Acting Secretary of War); Judah P. Benjamin—who served as Attorney General until 1865 and even played a part in negotiations with the British government during this time period when they sought to mediate peace talks between both sides involved in America's domestic conflicts over slavery policy issues—as well as numerous other ministers, advisors, ambassadors or diplomats who were instrumental contributors within Confederate politics.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Richmond was home to many notable buildings and institutions during its tenure as capital of the Confederacy including executive mansions like Monumental Church (originally constructed by Robert E Lee), Capitol Square which held both chambers: House Chambers in State Capitol Building, where key legislation took place; alongside Senate Chamber located within newly constructed Virginia State Penitentiary building. These structures were used extensively during this period to accommodate meetings between Confederate officials working hard toward safeguarding their nation's sovereignty from any external threats – including those originating beyond its borders like Great Britain who offered some support for the Confederacy through financial backing and trade opportunities when other nations such as France, Spain or Mexico did not reciprocate due political considerations at that time.\n\nIn summary: While there were several temporary capitals throughout their existence (e.g., Columbia), Richmond played a significant role in shaping history during America's most tumultuous period; ultimately, its historical significance is rooted deeply within the cultural heritage of Virginia and serves as an important reminder for future generations about our shared past experiences — regardless whether one agrees or disagrees with different perspectives involved at that time.", "answer": ["Veritas classical christian school", "The Mond", "City of Richmond, Virginia", "Richmond, Virginia (City)", "Richmond va", "Richmond, va", "Richmond virginia", "Veritas Classical Christian School", "Richmond (Va.)", "Richmond, VA", "Richmond (Virginia)", "Culture of Richmond, VA", "Richmond, Virginia", "Richmond (Independent City), Virginia", "St. Bridget School", "Richmond, Va", "Richmond Virginia", "Richmond (VA)", "Music of Richmond, Virginia", "Richmond, Va.", "Capital of Virginia", "Richmond, Virgina", "Richmond VA", "UN/LOCODE:USRIC", "Richmond, Virginia, USA", "Culture of Richmond, Virginia"], "correct": 1}

{"id": 5, "query": "Who was largely responsible for the development of the jet engine, seeing the first application of his engine installed in a Gloster aircraft in 1941?", "response": " The person who played a major role in developing the jet engine and saw its first application in an aircraft in 1941 is Sir Frank Whittle. Born on June 5th, 1907, in Cottingley, West Riding of Yorkshire (now part of Leeds), England, Whittle was an inventor and engineer who developed the idea for a jet engine during his time as a student at Oxford University, where he studied engineering.\n\nWhittle's idea was based on the principle that a jet engine could be powered by compressed air from its surroundings rather than relying on exhaust gases to push it forward like traditional piston engines. This concept later became known as the turbojet engine and paved the way for modern aircraft propulsion systems. He received British Patent Number 6,832 in January 1930, which detailed his jet-propelled aircraft design.\n\nIn 1941, the first jet engine was installed on a Gloster E.28/39 aircraft (later renamed the Gloster Meteor), marking an important milestone in the development of jet engines and aviation history. The jet engine allowed for more efficient and faster flight, which played a significant role in World War II by enabling fighters to catch up with and engage enemy bombers at high altitudes.\n\nThroughout his career, Whittle made numerous advancements in aircraft design and propulsion technology. He went on to develop the first turbojet engine that was suitable for use as an aircraft powerplant and established the first jet-powered airline service between England and France using a de Havilland Comet airliner equipped with his engines.\n\nFrank Whittle's work has left a lasting impact on aviation history, transforming the way we travel today. The development of the jet engine is one of his many significant contributions to technology and engineering that continues to influence the world around us.", "answer": ["Sir Frank Whittle", "Jet engine development", "Frank Whittle"], "correct": 1}

{"id": 7, "query": "What is the name of the city that was built to house workers on the Hoover Dam?", "response": " The city that was built to house workers on the Hoover Dam is called Boulder City. It was established in 1931 specifically for the purpose of providing housing and other facilities for the workers who were constructing the dam. Before Boulder City was built, many workers lived in tents or temporary shacks near the construction site, which made it difficult to provide proper living conditions and amenities.\n\nBoulder City was named after the nearby Black Mountains, which resemble a cluster of boulders on top of one another. The city was designed by John C. Austin, an architect who also designed other towns in Nevada during that period. The design incorporated traditional American architecture with Spanish-style buildings, making it look like a small western town.\n\nThe construction of the Hoover Dam required a massive workforce, and many workers came from different parts of the country to work on this project. To accommodate these workers, temporary camps were set up near the dam site where they lived in makeshift housing units. As the dam neared completion in 1935, it became clear that more permanent housing was needed for the growing population of workers and their families.\n\nBoulder City was established to provide this much-needed housing for the workers who had been building the Hoover Dam. The city initially consisted of several streets lined with single-story homes built by the government's Public Works Administration (PWA) using local materials such as stone, wood, brick, and stucco.\n\nThe residents of Boulder City were required to sign a contract agreeing not to sell their property for at least five years after purchase. This restriction was intended to prevent speculators from buying up land in the area and driving up prices once construction on the dam was completed. However, this requirement proved difficult to enforce, as many people could not afford to keep paying taxes on their properties without being able to sell them.\n\nToday, Boulder City is a thriving community with over 15,000 residents who enjoy a relaxed lifestyle near the beautiful surroundings of Lake Mead National Recreation Area. Despite its small size, it remains an important part of Nevada's history and continues to be a symbol of human resilience in the face of enormous challenges.", "answer": ["Boulder City, NV", "Boulder, Nevada", "Boulder City", "Boulder City, Nevada", "UN/LOCODE:USBLD"], "correct": 1}

It is primarily spoken by the people of Graubünden (Grisons) in eastern parts of the country, where it serves as a lingua franca for communication among speakers of different local dialects and languages such as German, Italian, and French.\n\nRomansh has its origins in Latin and evolved from Vulgar Latin spoken by Roman soldiers stationed in what is now Switzerland during the Roman Empire's occupation (around 15 BCE to around 476 CE). The language underwent several changes over time due to isolation and contact with other languages, leading to variations in pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar among different regions.\n\nThe four main dialects of Romansh are:\n\n1. Puter - spoken in the Albula Valley (Müstair) and the Surses region (Surses).\n2. Davos - spoken mainly around Davos and Klosters.\n3. Surmiran - primarily spoken in the Engadin valley, along with parts of Graubünden and Lombardy.\n4. Veltlinian/Ladinu - spoken by the Walser people in some valleys near the Swiss-Italian border (such as Upper Engadin).\n\nRomansh is recognized under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and has gained more visibility over recent decades, with various efforts being made to preserve and promote this unique language within Switzerland. For example, Romansh-language schools exist in several municipalities across Graubünden, where children are taught both the local dialects and Standard German as well.\n\nAdditionally, many books, newspapers, magazines, radio programs, and other media have been developed for different regions of speakers to use their native language more frequently.

{"id": 21, "query": "Who had a minor hit in 1986 with the song Santa Claus Is On The Dole?", "response": " In 1986, \"Santa Claus is on the dole\" was an amusing and satirical phrase that gained attention due to its use as the title of a novelty holiday tune. This catchy and quirky Christmas anthem became quite popular during the festive season despite being released by an independent label without a big marketing budget or extensive radio airplay.\n\nThe song, performed by English comedian Noddy Holder (also known for his role in the British rock band Slade), humorously explores various aspects of modern-day society and culture through its lyrics. As the title suggests, \"Santa Claus Is on the Dole\" delves into the idea that Santa Claus himself might be out of work due to changing economic conditions affecting gift distribution during Christmas time.\n\nThroughout the song, Noddy Holder portrays various characters, such as a department store worker who has been given an extra day off by management because they cannot afford to pay him or her; a man who claims that he can't find employment despite being \"Santa Claus material\"; and a single mother struggling with financial hardship.\n\nThe song also touches on societal issues like homelessness, unemployment, and the struggles faced by working-class families during Christmastime: \"Father Christmas has been laid off/ And now it’s up to us/ To make sure that our kids don't cry.\"\n\nThe lyrics were written by Noddy Holder himself along with music composer David Kernan. The track was released on 7th December 1986 as a single under the PWL Recordings label, which was owned and operated by Pete Waterman (of the production duo Stock Aitken Waterman) and his partner Chris Grant.\n\nPete Waterman has been quoted saying about \"Santa Claus is on the dole\": \"It's just one of those things that happened - I thought it would be a good laugh to do something different at Christmas time.\" The song was not intended to have any significant commercial impact, but its catchy tune and clever lyrics struck a chord with listeners who found it refreshingly lighthearted during an otherwise serious holiday season.\n\n\"Santa Claus Is on the Dole\" reached No. 58 in the UK Singles Chart upon its release, garnering attention from music critics and fans alike. The song may not have topped charts or enjoyed extensive radio airplay like traditional seasonal favorites but it certainly left a lasting impression on those who heard it.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Santa Claus Is on the Dole\" is an example of how even unconventional holiday tunes can create interest and become part of popular culture during the festive season. This satirical song may not have been intended to be a big hit upon its release in 1986, but its impact has lasted through the years as it continues to bring laughter and joy for those who listen each year around Christmastime.", "answer": ["Rubber News", "Spitting Image (show)", "Fluck and Law", "Spitting image", "Spitting Image"], "correct": 0}

{"id": 29, "query": "The word psalm derives from meaning a song sung to what instrument?", "response": " Psalm is derived from the Greek word \"psallein,\" which means \"to play on a stringed instrument.\" This term was later adopted into Latin as \"psalmum\" and then into English, where it eventually became known as \"psalm.\" The psalms are songs or hymns that were originally sung to worship God. They can be found in the Bible within the Book of Psalms, which is part of the Hebrew Scripture (Tanakh) and Christian Old Testament.\n\nThe primary instrument accompanying psalms was generally a stringed instrument such as a harp, lyre, or other musical instruments used by temple choirs and synagogues during biblical times. The use of these instruments helped create a rhythmic and melodic backdrop for the singers to harmoniously express their devotion and praise towards God. Over time, additional instruments were incorporated into Jewish and Christian liturgical music as composers added complexity to the psalms through various arrangements and adaptations.\n\nIn summary, the word \"psalm\" originates from Greek and is derived from a term meaning \"to play on a stringed instrument.\" The primary accompaniment for these songs was traditionally provided by a musical instrument like a harp or lyre that helped create an uplifting sound as they were sung in praise of God during worship services.", "answer": ["Harpist", "Triangular harp", "Harps", "Folk harp", "Nabla (instrument)", "Frame Harp", "Frame harp", "Harp museum", "Harp"], "correct": 1}

{"id": 34, "query": "Which old British coin was known as a 'tester'?", "response": " The term \"tester\" in relation to coins refers specifically to the halfpenny, which was worth one-twentieth of a shilling or 1/240 of a pound sterling. It is derived from the Old Norse word \"þessi,\" meaning half, and it was used as an abbreviation for this coin denomination.\n\nThe term \"tester\" has since become less commonly used in modern English, but its historical use provides context on how certain old British coins were referred to. The history of money in Britain stretches back thousands of years with various currencies having been used throughout different periods.\n\nCoins have played an essential role in trade and commerce as a medium of exchange for goods or services, serving the economic needs of societies. Throughout its long history, coinage has evolved through changes in technology, political systems, and social structures. Let's explore how the halfpenny came into being and why it was eventually replaced by other coins:\n\nThe halfpenny (or \"tester\") originated during the time when Britain was still using a system of currency known as pounds, shillings, and pence, or more commonly referred to as Sterling Currency. The pound is divided into 20 shillings, with each shilling further subdivided into 12 pennies; this created a base unit of value for transactions that was easily understood by the general populace at the time.\n\nThe halfpenny evolved from earlier coinage denominations like farthings (worth one-quarter penny) and ha'pennies (half a penny). As Britain transitioned towards decimal currency in 1971, the old Sterling system gradually fell out of use. By this point, coins such as the sixpence, shilling, florin, and pound coin had replaced their older counterparts in circulation.\n\nThe halfpenny was eventually discontinued altogether on December 31st, 1960, when decimal currency became standard across all transactions within the UK. The discontinuation of old British coins like the tester allowed for a more efficient monetary system that better suited modern needs and economies. Today, you will only find references to these older coin denominations in numismatic circles or as historical artifacts in museums.\n\nTo summarize, \"tester\" is an old term used to refer to halfpenny coins in Britain's currency history, which were worth one-twentieth of a shilling or 1/240 of a pound sterling. The system eventually transitioned from pounds, shillings, and pence to decimal currency and the usage of these older coin denominations gradually diminished over time.", "answer": ["6d", "Sixpence", "Sixpence (disambiguation)"], "correct": 1}

Their football team was established on March 15th, 1905 by a group of students from the French Galata College (now known as Galatasaray High School).

The film itself does not have a conventional narrative structure or plotline; instead, it relies heavily on visual and auditory elements to convey its message.\n\nThe absence of an easily identifiable lead actor in \"Film\" may leave some viewers wondering who portrayed the unnamed character that is at the center of this one-of-a-kind film experience. However, given Beckett's involvement as both writer and star of the production, it can be said that his presence – along with the various visual elements and sound design – becomes an integral aspect of the cinematic experience itself.\n\nIt is essential to remember that \"Film\" was not created to be a traditional film in terms of its narrative structure or plot; instead, Beckett aimed to explore new dimensions in theatre by incorporating aspects like silence, movement, light, and darkness into his work. In this respect, the lack of focus on any particular actor allows for greater exploration and experimentation with these elements within the context of the filmic medium.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is no single lead actor mentioned specifically when discussing \"Film,\" Samuel Beckett's involvement as writer and star contributes significantly to creating an immersive experience that challenges conventional notions about both theatre and cinema.

{"id": 46, "query": "Which 1982 film is based on the 1968 sci-fi novel by Philip K Dick “Do androids dream of electric sheep’?", "response": " The 1982 film \"Blade Runner\" directed by Ridley Scott is an adaptation of the 1968 science fiction novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" written by Philip K. Dick. This classic movie explores themes such as artificial intelligence, consciousness, and what it means to be human. It stars Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, a former police officer turned bounty hunter in a dystopian future where replicants (artificial beings) have been created for various purposes, including work in off-world colonies. The story centers around the hunt for rogue replicants who return to Earth illegally, and the moral dilemmas that arise during this process.\n\nThe film's visual style has become iconic and is characterized by its dark atmosphere, rain-soaked streets, neon lighting, and the fusion of cyberpunk aesthetics with noir elements. The movie features a memorable score composed by Vangelis, which adds to the overall mood of the story. \"Blade Runner\" received positive reviews upon release but has since become a beloved classic in science fiction cinema, with fans and critics praising its themes, world-building, and visuals.\n\nThe film's most famous scene is Deckard's confrontation with Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), one of the rogue replicants who questions his humanity before ultimately dying. This moment has become a symbol of existential reflection and the struggle for survival in an often cruel universe. The movie also explores themes of love, empathy, and what it means to have emotions when there are no biological limitations on life or death.\n\nIn 2007-2008, \"Blade Runner\" underwent a recut titled \"Blade Runner: The Final Cut,\" which included new scenes that were not present in the original release but had been filmed by Ridley Scott during production. This version aimed to provide a more satisfying narrative for viewers and received positive critical reception.\n\nIn 2017, an updated sequel/reboot was released titled \"Blade Runner 2049,\" directed by Denis Villeneuve and starring Ryan Gosling as K. A new generation of replicants has been created with the goal of creating a slave race for off-world colonies, which leads to conflict between their creators and humanity. The film continues the themes explored in the original \"Blade Runner\" while offering its own unique perspectives on artificial intelligence, consciousness, and what it means to be human or nonhuman.\n\nOverall, Ridley Scott's 1982 adaptation of Philip K. Dick's novel has had a significant impact on science fiction cinema, shaping a genre that explores complex ideas about existence, identity, and the boundaries between humans and artificial beings within an ever-changing technological landscape.", "answer": ["V-K", "Blade Runner 2 (2014 film)", "Voigt-kampff machine", "Voigt kampff machine", "Voigt-kampff test", "Voit-kampf test", "Voigt kampff", "Blade Runner (film)", "Voit kampf test", "C beams", "Voight-Kampff machine", "Voit-kampf", "Blade Runner 2 (film)", "Spinner (Blade Runner)", "Voight Kampff", "Voit kampf", "Blade Runner 2", "Voigt-Kampff machine", "BLADE RUNNER (1982)", "Methuselah Syndrome", "Blade Runner", "Leon Kowalski", "Voigt-Kampff", "Blade Runner 2 (film project)", "Voight-Kampff", "Voigt-Kampf", "Blade runner (film)", "Dangerous Days", "Untitled Blade Runner Sequel", "Voigt-Kampff test", "Blade Runner (1982 film)", "Voight-Kampf", "Blade runner", "Voight-Kampff test", "Blade Runner (2014 film)"], "correct": 1}

The last time a pope resigned had been over six centuries ago during the Avignon Papacy that lasted from 1309 to 1378.\n\nAlthough he could have continued serving until his death, Pope Benedict XVI chose not to do so and made way for a new leader who would be better able to handle the spiritual duties required of him in light of the increasing challenges facing the Church. The College of Cardinals was subsequently summoned to elect the next pope from among their ranks as per tradition.\n\nDuring the conclave, which took place between March 12th and March 13th, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI himself) was elected as Pope Francis on March 13th, 2013.

He was an influential figure in Lebanon's politics before becoming president of the country from 1988 to 1990. During this time, he led a faction that sought to undermine the Syrian presence in Lebanon and promote Lebanese independence. This period is often referred to as \"the Cedar Revolution\" or \"The Intifada,\" after a political uprising against Syria's control over Lebanon.\n\nBefore becoming president of Lebanon, Michel Aoun had been an influential military commander who played a pivotal role during the country’s civil war (1975-1990). He was initially supported by Israel and the West but eventually became embroiled in conflicts with other factions within Lebanon, including those allied with Syria.\n\nIn 1988, Aoun started to form his faction known as \"Kataeb\" party (Lebanese Phalange Party), which sought to challenge Syrian influence over Lebanese politics by advocating for the country's independence from foreign intervention and promoting a more democratic government in Lebanon. His movement became increasingly popular among the Lebanese people who were dissatisfied with Syria’s rule, leading many to believe that Aoun would be able to lead them toward greater freedom and sovereignty.\n\nHowever, his efforts faced opposition from other political factions within Lebanon that sought to maintain ties with their Syrian counterparts. This led to a series of escalating confrontations between Aoun's faction (Kataeb) and these opposing groups. As the situation worsened, tensions grew between those supporting Syria’s role in Lebanon versus those advocating for Lebanese independence from foreign intervention.\n\nIn response, on April 23rd, 1989, Syrian forces invaded Lebanon under the pretext of protecting it against further internal strife. This invasion effectively ended Aoun's bid for power and led to a long period of political instability in the country that would continue until his eventual resignation from office as president in May 1990.\n\nDuring this time (from 1988-1990), Michel Aoun's movement disrupted the stability within Lebanon, leading it on a path toward greater conflict with its neighboring nations and paving the way for further political uncertainty that would last well into the future.", "answer": ["Lebanese Republic", "Lebanone", "Lubnan", "Al-Jumhūrīyah al-Lubnānīyah", "Administrative divisions of lebanon", "Literature of Lebanon", "Lebannon", "Etymology of Lebanon", "Lubnān", "الجمهورية اللبنانية", "Lebnen", "Lebnan", "LBN", "Republic of Lebanon", "ISO 3166-1:LB", "Libano", "Ryan Attiyeh", "Liban", "لبنان", "Languages of Lebanon", "Art in Lebanon", "Lubnaniyah", "Libanese", "The Lebanon", "Health in Lebanon", "Al Jumhuriyah al Lubnaniyah", "Al-Jumhūrīyyah al-Lubnānīyyah", "Libanon", "Libán", "Festivals in Lebanon", "Name of Lebanon", "Lebanon", "Architecture of lebanon", "State of Lebanon"], "correct": 1}

It's one of Europe's most important achievements in technology, with roots going back to the early 1970s when it was designed as part of a plan to break Europe's dependence on foreign launchers for its satellite launches.\n\nThe Ariane rocket program is managed by Arianespace and involves several European countries including France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Spain, and Luxembourg. It has launched over 1,200 satellites into space since the first launch in 1979. The name 'Ariane' itself comes from a Greek goddess known as the virgin huntress.\n\nThe Ariane rockets use liquid propellant technology which allows them to be extremely flexible when it comes to mission needs and payloads because they can be adapted easily. They are also very powerful, with each launch vehicle having three main stages that use hydrazine (a type of rocket fuel) in combination with liquid oxygen as its propellants.\n\nThese rockets have different versions - Ariane 5 ES, Ariane 6 and the latest being Ariane 62 which is yet to be operational but expected to be a leap forward from the earlier models due to improvements in propulsion efficiency. The rocket can lift about 8 tons into low Earth orbit (LEO) and over 4 tons to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).\n\nFor more information on Ariane rockets, you can visit websites like Wikipedia or NASA’s webpage for detailed technical specifications of each version of the vehicle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5_(rocket) and https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/ariane-6", "answer": ["Ariane", "ARIANE", "Ariane (disambiguation)", "Arianne"], "correct": 1}

{"id": 59, "query": "Which exponent of Brit Art created works involving a bed, a tent and a beach hut?", "response": " The artist who created works involving a bed, a tent, and a beach hut as central elements in their art is the British artist Damien Hirst. Born on June 7th, 1965, in Bristol, England, Hirst rose to prominence during the 1980s and 1990s as one of the key figures in the Brit Art movement, along with contemporaries like Tracey Emin, Sarah Lucas, and Sam Taylor-Johnson.\n\nDamien Hirst's artwork often explores themes related to life, death, beauty, and decay. His practice spans various media such as painting, sculpture, installation art, and photography. One of his most famous pieces is the \"The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living\" (1991), a 4.8-meter tiger shark preserved in a tank of formaldehyde. This iconic piece highlights Hirst's fascination with mortality and the human relationship with death.\n\nAnother notable work featuring a bed is \"A Thousand Years\" (1990), where a bed is surrounded by flies that are about to lay eggs, symbolizing the transience of life and the inevitability of decay. This piece highlights Hirst's interest in exploring various aspects of human existence through his art.\n\nHirst's 1998 work \"A shell room\" features a tent-like structure adorned with numerous shells, inviting viewers to explore their tactile qualities and contemplate the natural world. The installation emphasizes the importance of nature in our lives and prompts us to ponder its beauty and fragility.\n\nIn addition to these works, Hirst has also created several beach hut installations. For example, his 2015 exhibition \"No Love Lost\" at White Cube Bermondsey featured a series of beach huts painted with bright colors that were contrasted by dark, morbid themes within the structures themselves. Another piece, titled \"A Thousand Years,\" features a similarly themed bed surrounded by flies and encased in glass (a recurring motif throughout Hirst's work).\n\nIn conclusion, Damien Hirst is an important artist who has contributed significantly to the Brit Art movement of the late 20th century. His work often revolves around themes like death, beauty, decay, and the human condition, as seen through his various creations involving a bed, a tent, and a beach hut.", "answer": ["Tracey Emin", "Tracy Emin"], "correct": 1}

{"id": 61, "query": "How did James F Fixx, promoter of jogging for good health, die in 1984?", "response": " James Fixx was a fitness expert and author who became known for promoting the idea that jogging could be an effective form of exercise to improve one's health. He wrote several books on fitness and exercise, including the best-selling \"The Complete Book of Running,\" which advocated for the benefits of regular aerobic activity like running as a way to reduce the risk of heart disease and other health issues.\n\nIn 1977, Fixx suffered a massive heart attack while jogging in rural Vermont. He was rushed to the hospital but could not be revived, passing away at the age of 52. His death made headlines around the world and raised questions about whether his love of running may have contributed to his untimely demise.\n\nThe medical examiner's initial investigation concluded that Fixx had died from a myocardial infarction (heart attack), which was believed to be caused by blockages in one or more coronary arteries, leading to the death of heart tissue. This type of event can occur when plaque builds up over time on the inside walls of blood vessels, narrowing them and making it difficult for oxygen-rich blood to flow properly. In some cases, a clot can form within these narrowed passages and block the flow altogether, cutting off circulation to the heart muscle, which is why Fixx's death was attributed to cardiac causes.\n\nFollowing his death, there were debates about whether or not jogging could be harmful for one's health. Some experts argued that the stress associated with running might contribute to a higher risk of cardiovascular events in certain individuals, while others maintained that it remained an effective form of exercise and recommended moderate-intensity aerobic activity as part of a healthy lifestyle.\n\nRegardless of these debates, Fixx left behind a legacy as one of America's most influential fitness experts and the founder of \"jogging for health\" movement in the 1970s and 80s. His work continues to impact people's perspectives on exercise and its potential benefits, although it remains essential to consider individual factors such as age, fitness level, and medical history when recommending any form of physical activity.", "answer": ["Heart attack while jogging"], "correct": 1}

Over their relatively short period together (from 1960 to 1970), they revolutionized popular music, changed attitudes towards race and sexuality, and inspired countless artists that followed in their wake.\n\nAs a solo artist and with his subsequent group Wings, McCartney continued to produce numerous hits while also pushing creative boundaries both musically and conceptually; he explored new territories like concept albums, multimedia projects, and collaborations with diverse musicians from all walks of life. His commitment towards social activism throughout the 1970s led him down paths that would impact not just his own career but also broader societal issues such as environmentalism, animal rights, and peace advocacy.\n\nIn \"Last Chorus,\" McCartney candidly discusses these experiences alongside more personal anecdotes about growing up in Liverpool during World War II; learning music from an early age with help from mentors like George Martin (the legendary producer behind many Beatles albums), Maurice Gibb of the Bee Gees, jazz musician George Shearing among others. His narrative also touches upon relationships he's had throughout his life – including both friendships and romantic partnerships - providing readers insight into how those experiences shaped him as a person and artist.\n\nOne could argue that \"Last Chorus\" is not just another autobiography about an iconic rockstar but rather reflects on the many facets of life in general, weaving together themes related to music creation, fame & fortune, personal growth, family matters alongside broader societal commentary – all set against backdrop stories reflecting those unique experiences which have shaped his journey.\n\nIn sum, \"Last Chorus: An Autobiographical Medley\" is a remarkable work that highlights the essence of Paul McCartney's life story and career in its entirety. It provides readers an intimate glimpse into both the personal and professional triumphs as well as challenges faced by one of the most influential musicians in modern history, all while reminding us that even those who seem to have it all still grapple with similar human experiences we can all relate to.", "answer": ["Humph", "HUMPHREY LYTTELTON", "Humphrey Lyttelton", "Humphrey Lyttelton Band", "The Humphrey Lyttelton Band", "Humphrey Lyttleton"], "correct": 0}

Inferno (Hell): The first section, and arguably the most well-known, chronicles Dante's journey through Hell (Inferno). This part of the poem is divided into ten circles or \"cantiche\" (the \"terza cantica\"), each representing a different vice or sin.

It is a tidal power station that was commissioned in 1966 and remains one of the world's largest operational tidal power plants to date. The facility generates clean renewable energy using the natural tidal fluctuations of the Raz-de-Sein estuary between Brittany and Jersey.\n\nThe Rance Barrage, also known as La Rance Dam or Le Barrage de l'Authie, is a gravity dam that was built across the Raz-de-Sein estuary to create the necessary water level variations for the operation of the tidal power station. The barrage consists of four parallel gates and three sections of dikes made of concrete with a total length of 2410 meters (7906 feet).\n\nThe Rance Barrage is considered as the first example of a large-scale tidal power station, demonstrating that it was technically feasible to generate electricity using ocean tides. Prior to the development of this technology in France, the idea of harnessing the energy from tides for electricity production was viewed as unfeasible due to its complexity and lack of understanding of how tides worked.\n\nThe Rance Barrage played a crucial role in proving that tidal power could be an important source of renewable energy, paving the way for similar projects worldwide. The success of this project led to increased interest and investment in research and development of other marine or tidal power technologies globally, contributing significantly to the growth of the clean energy sector.\n\nIn conclusion, the Rance Barrage is the first example of a large-scale tidal power station that demonstrated its technical feasibility by generating electricity from ocean tides through the operation of the Rance Tidal Power Station.", "answer": ["Tidal lagoon", "Tidal harnesses", "Tidal stream turbine", "Tide power", "Hydro-kinetic power", "Tidal power station", "Hydrokinetic energy", "Tidal Power", "Tidal generation", "Tidal power plant", "Tidal barrage power", "Hydrokinetic power", "Tidal power", "Tidal energy", "Tidal harness", "Tidal power plants"], "correct": 1}

{"id": 86, "query": "What is the name of the curved knife traditionally used by Gurkha soldiers?", "response": " The curved knife traditionally used by Gurkha soldiers, known as \"Kukri,\" is a traditional weapon and utility tool that originates from the Nepalese people. It has been an essential part of their culture for centuries and has become synonymous with the bravery and determination of the Gurkhas - a term which refers to the military personnel originating from Nepal.\n\nThe Kukri, also spelled as Khukuri in some contexts, is renowned for its distinctiveness among other knives globally. It possesses an imposing curved blade that can measure anywhere between 10 inches (25 cm) and over two feet (60 cm). The Kukri's distinctive shape results from the combination of a long straight cutting edge with an inward-curving hook, which allows it to perform multiple functions such as chopping wood, clearing vegetation, self-defense, skinning animals, or even as a means for carrying water.\n\nThe blade is traditionally constructed out of high carbon steel and features a convex grind that results in sharp edges. The handle, on the other hand, can be made from various materials such as wood (usually sal), horn, bone, or a composite material called \"daal\". One end of the handle typically terminates in a metal knob termed as 'Punkha,' which is usually adorned with brass or aluminum plating and adds to the overall aesthetic appeal.\n\nThe Kukri's history dates back centuries when it was used primarily for agricultural work, hunting, and warfare. Over time, its significance expanded beyond just being an everyday tool into a powerful symbol of identity, loyalty, strength, and courage for the Gurkha soldiers. The Gurkhas have become legendary in military annals for their combat skills and ferocious fighting prowess, which has been significantly bolstered by this versatile weapon.\n\nToday, the Kukri continues to be an integral part of the Nepalese identity and is used extensively within Nepal's borders, as well as outside through the Gurkha regiments that are part of various military forces worldwide, such as those in India, United Kingdom (UK), Canada, Australia, and others.

To break down further into its components, 'hircus' comes from Latin which means pig, while '-ine' is a suffix that forms adjectives indicating a close relationship to something else.\n\nPigs are found across various parts of the world and have adapted themselves well in different environments due to their omnivorous diet and strong bodies. They have become an integral part of human societies, serving both as food for humans as well as performing tasks like hunting, herding, or transporting goods in some rural communities.\n\nPigs are generally social animals that live in groups known as sounders, led by the largest female within it which is often called a sow. The term 'hircine' applies to pigs because their physical and behavioral traits closely resemble those of each other within this genus. They have tusks (or in some cases just one tusk) growing from their lower jaw that they use for defense or digging up roots, tubers, or insects beneath the ground surface.\n\nPigs can be identified by various features such as a curved snout and bristly hair, which helps them to dig easily within mud when wallowing or taking dust baths. They have large ears compared to their body size, allowing them to dissipate heat effectively and keep cool even during warmer climates. Moreover, pigs sport a robust muscular build that aids in moving about efficiently through various terrains.\n\nThe hircine adjective is an important part of the English language because it allows us to specifically refer to different types of pig species within their scientific families or genera – in this case, Hirinae (also called Suinea). This classification helps scientists and researchers understand more clearly how pigs have evolved over time and what sets them apart from other related animals.\n\nIn conclusion, the adjective 'hircine' is used to describe an animal belonging to the genus \"Hir,\" which specifically refers to a pig or swine species within its family Suidae. This word plays an essential role in understanding these fascinating creatures better while offering us an insight into their unique features and characteristics that make them such diverse, interesting animals on our planet.", "answer": ["The Goat (film)", "Goats (disambiguation)", "The Goat (disambiguation)", "Goat (film)", "G.o.a.t", "Goat (disambiguation)", "GOAT", "The Goat"], "correct": 0}
{"id": 89, "query": "What part of a bird might also be a term for a magistrate?", "response": " The word \"magistrate\" comes from the Latin word \"magister,\" which means \"teacher.\" In ancient Rome, magistrates were government officials who had the authority to make decisions and enforce laws. They were like teachers because they helped to educate people about how society should be organized and run. So when we talk about a bird that might also be called a magistrate, we're talking about something that helps teach others or has some kind of teaching role in its community.", "answer": ["Beak (band)", "BEAK"], "correct": 0}

This is quite an accomplishment and a testament to how well-managed the event was over time. Let me tell you more about this!\n\nAfter hosting the Summer Olympic Games in 1976, Montreal had taken out a lot of loans (like when you borrow money from your parents for something) to finance the event. As with any big party or gathering, there are costs involved like food, decorations and hiring people to help manage everything - things called 'facilities' management and so on!\n\nAs years went by after the games were over, Montreal had been slowly paying back these loans (kind of like when you need to pay your parents back for what you borrowed). It took them a long time but they didn’t stop trying. They knew it was important not just for their city's finances - but also as an example that even big and ambitious projects can be managed responsibly!\n\nSo, after 30 years of paying off the debt (which is like your friend saving up to buy his favorite toy over several weeks), they finally completed their final payment on June 23rd in 2006. This was a major milestone for Montreal and it showed that even big projects can be finished with patience, determination and responsible financial management!", "answer": ["The end of 2006"], "correct": 0}
