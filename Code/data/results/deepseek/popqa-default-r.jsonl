Born on March 26th, 1938, he started playing football at a young age, demonstrating exceptional skills that led to a successful career both as a player and later as a manager.\n\nGrondona began his professional football journey with Montevideo Wanderers Fútbol Club in Uruguay, where he made a name for himself as an attacking midfielder. His performances earned him the attention of different clubs within Argentina and abroad, ultimately resulting in a move to River Plate in 1962. At River Plate, Grondona continued his fine form, playing alongside other renowned players such as Daniel Passarella and Mario Boyé. He won several titles with the club during his time there, including two Argentine Championships (1963 and 1964).\n\nAfter retiring from active football in 1972, Grondona transitioned into management. His first managerial role was at River Plate again, where he had previously played for a decade earlier. In the early stages of his coaching career, Grondona experienced mixed success; however, he later found steady success with other teams like Talleres de Córdoba and Racing Club in Argentina as well as clubs abroad such as Spanish giants Real Madrid during the 1980s.\n\nGustavo Grondona is best remembered for his role within CONMEBOL (Confederation of South American Football), where he held various positions throughout his career. From 1976 to 2005, he worked in multiple roles at this confederation level - such as being a member of the Executive Committee and serving as president on two occasions. Notably, Grondona was instrumental in organizing several key tournaments like Copa América (CONMEBOL's flagship tournament) as well as qualification rounds for FIFA World Cups.\n\nDuring his tenure at CONMEBOL, he made significant efforts to promote both football development and the overall welfare of South American nations. One notable initiative was his push for fair play within competitions through strict implementation of disciplinary measures for those found guilty of unsporting behavior or corruption - an effort that earned him respect across many continents.\n\nGustavo Grondona passed away on June 16th, 2014. He left behind a legacy not only as an accomplished football player and manager but also due to his significant contributions within the sports industry worldwide. His vision of creating fair play environments has been crucial in shaping modern-day international competitions like FIFA World Cup qualifiers where integrity is placed at higher esteem than ever before.", "answer": ["Buenos Aires", "Buenos Ayres", "Autonomous City of Buenos Aires", "CABA", "Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires"], "correct": 0}

Born on April 16, 1824, he contributed significantly to the scientific community during his lifetime through his research, observations, and discoveries related to animals, particularly their physiology and behavior. His contributions have made him an important figure in the history of veterinary medicine and animal science.\n\nQuebec City is a historic city located in eastern Canada along the banks of the St. Lawrence River. It was founded in 1608 by French explorer Samuel de Champlain, and it has since become one of the oldest cities in North America. Quebec City is known for its rich history, beautiful architecture, picturesque streets, and cultural diversity.\n\nThe city played a crucial role in Lavallée's life and career as an environment that allowed him to grow intellectually, develop his passion for zoology, and eventually build on his knowledge about animal physiology through the research he conducted at the local Université Laval, which was then known as the Royal Military College of Canada.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Louis-Arsène Lavallée had several achievements in veterinary medicine and related fields. For instance:\n\n1. His discovery of the role played by the thyroid gland in metabolism is a significant contribution to the field of endocrinology that laid the groundwork for understanding hormone regulation in animals and humans.\n\n2. He identified an essential amino acid, tryptophan, which plays a crucial part in many biological processes within animals. This discovery contributed significantly to our knowledge about animal nutrition and the balance required between different nutrients in their diets.\n\n3. In addition to his work as a zoologist and veterinarian, Lavallée was also instrumental in developing teaching programs at Université Laval and played an essential role in promoting scientific research throughout Canada. His dedication to education and research paved the way for future generations of scientists to build on his discoveries.\n\nAlthough Louis-Arsène Lavallée passed away on February 28, 1874, he left behind a legacy as a prominent zoologist, a dedicated teacher, and an invaluable source of inspiration for many in the fields related to animal science, veterinary medicine, endocrinology, and more.

This charming town boasts a rich history that dates back to Roman times and has witnessed numerous changes over time.\n\nAshford, situated along the River Medway, is surrounded by picturesque countryside, providing an idyllic setting for its residents. The town itself features well-preserved historic buildings, such as Ashford Castle and other structures dating back to medieval times. As you explore this charming locale, it's easy to imagine a young Charles Plumer being raised in the midst of these historical marvels.\n\nThe town's early history is primarily centered around its location along an ancient route known as \"Watling Street,\" which connected London with Dover and Canterbury – two important cities during Roman times. This strategic position led Ashford to become a significant hub for trade, commerce, and industry throughout the centuries that followed. Consequently, it played a crucial role in shaping Plumer's life and career, given his prominence as an English barrister and politician.\n\nAshford remained an essential town within its county until 1890 when it was granted borough status by Queen Victoria herself, marking an important milestone for the community. Throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century, this town continued to grow and develop as a center of industry and commerce in West Sussex County.\n\nIt's during these times that Plumer would have been growing up in Ashford; perhaps even attending local schools or participating in community events alongside other young people who would also go on to make significant contributions to their own fields. As he grew older, his intellect, commitment, and dedication to the law would eventually lead him down a path of success, ultimately earning him recognition as Sir Charles James Plumer – an eminent figure known for his efforts in temperance reform and political achievements during his time.\n\nIn summary, Charles Plumer was born in Ashford, West Sussex County, England, where he spent much of his formative years surrounded by the rich history and natural beauty that defined this picturesque town.

{"id": 261, "query": "In what city was Francisco María Oreamuno Bonilla born?", "response": " Francisco Maria Oreamuno Bonilla, the former President of Costa Rica, was born in Heredia, a city located just north of the capital city of San Jose. Born on February 27th, 1853, he went on to become an important figure in the nation's legal and political landscape during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nOreamuno was born into a prominent family with strong ties to the nation's political elite. His father, Francisco María Oreamuno Fernández, had been both a senator and mayor of Heredia. As such, it is not surprising that young Francisco would follow in his father's footsteps by pursuing a career in public service and eventually becoming a prominent politician himself.\n\nOreamuno received his early education at home before attending the National University of Costa Rica to study law. Upon earning his degree, he returned to Heredia where he began practicing law and quickly established a reputation as an accomplished attorney. In 1876, Oreamuno was appointed as a judge in Alajuela by President Alfredo González Flores. After serving for several years in this role, he was promoted to the Supreme Court of Costa Rica in 1903 under President José María Castro Madriz.\n\nOreamuno's political career began when he became involved with the Conservative Party and served as a member of its central committee from 1876 to 1882. He then moved on to hold various positions in local government, including serving as mayor of Heredia between 1903 and 1905 and again between 1907 and 1909.\n\nAs a politician, Oreamuno was well-known for his commitment to upholding the Constitution and defending the rights of citizens. His dedication to these principles played an important role in shaping Costa Rica's political landscape during one of its most challenging periods. In particular, he emerged as a vocal supporter of President José Joaquín Trejos Vargas when the latter was under threat from radical elements within his own party in 1948.\n\nPerhaps Oreamuno's most significant achievement came when he assumed the presidency on December 8th, 1940. Serving until May 8th of the following year, he became only the second person to serve as President of Costa Rica twice (after Rafael Iglesias Guardia). During his tenure in office, Oreamuno focused on improving public infrastructure and healthcare services while also promoting economic development initiatives throughout the nation.\n\nFrancisco Maria Oreamuno Bonilla's legacy endures even today in Heredia where a statue dedicated to him stands as an enduring reminder of this important figure in Costa Rican history. His dedication to both his country and its legal system has left a lasting impact that continues to shape modern-day Costa Rica, solidifying his place as one of the nation's most influential leaders.", "answer": ["Cartago", "Cartago, Costa Rica"], "correct": 0}

{"id": 550, "query": "In what country is Saint-Vincent-de-Salers?", "response": " St. Vincent de Salers is a cheese, not a place or location in the world. It is a town located in southwestern France and has been famous for its soft and creamy cheese production since at least the 12th century. The name comes from Saint Vincent of Saragossa who was martyred around 304 AD during the persecution under Emperor Diocletian, which means that he died about 5 centuries before the town existed.\n\nThe region where St. Vincent de Salers is produced is known for its pastoral landscapes and dairy farms, with a rugged terrain of high plateaus, rolling hills, and numerous streams and rivers running through them. The local cattle breeds are typically derived from French Longhorn Cattle or Montbéliarde breeds, which produce milk ideal for cheese production due to their higher fat content than other European varieties.\n\nThe cheese itself is made using traditional methods passed down over centuries by generations of cheesemakers who use raw cow's milk to make the cheese in large round molds called \"tommes.\" The process involves curdling the milk with an enzyme, pressing it into a mold for 24 hours, then removing any excess whey and rinsing the cheese before aging it.\n\nThe result is a firm but crumbly texture with a mild flavor that is considered by many to be among France's finest cheeses. St. Vincent de Salers has been granted both AOC (Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée) status, which ensures its quality and origin within France since 1978; it was also added to UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage in 2016 due to its long history as well-regarded product.\n\nSo while there is no direct answer to the question concerning St Vincent de Salers being located in a country, we can confirm that this cheese originates from an area within France known for pastoral landscapes and high quality dairy products where cheesemakers have been crafting traditional methods into a delicacy enjoyed worldwide today.", "answer": ["France", "fr", "FR", "République française", "La France", "Republic of France", "French Republic", "FRA", "the Hexagon"], "correct": 1}

It was originally founded by the Royal Irish Academy to \"promote and regulate\" the study of chemistry throughout all parts of Ireland. At that time, it was located in a number of buildings around Dublin. By 1906, it moved into its current building on St Stephen's Green in central Dublin, where it is currently housed today.\n\nThe Institute of Chemistry (IOC) is the national chemical society for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. It was established to promote the advancement of chemistry throughout those regions, with a primary focus on the professional development of chemists. The organization also aims to advance public awareness of chemistry as well as its importance in various fields such as health care, environment protection, energy production, and more.\n\nThe Institute's main objective is to serve the chemical sciences community by providing support for research projects, workshops and seminars, education programs, networking opportunities, and other initiatives that promote the development of the field within Ireland. It collaborates with various organizations both domestically and internationally in order to achieve its mission. \n\nIn addition to conducting scientific research, the IOC also hosts regular meetings where chemists from all over the world can present their work or discuss ongoing projects. These events help foster international collaboration and contribute significantly towards advancing knowledge within this field.\n\nOverall, while not being directly associated with a specific nation state like most countries, The Institute of Chemistry (IOC) is indeed an integral part of Ireland's scientific community. Its main focus on promoting chemistry as well as its professional development among chemists in the region has allowed it to play a significant role in shaping how chemistry and related fields are viewed within these regions over time.", "answer": ["Ireland", "Éire", "IE", "IRL", "Republic of Ireland", "Hibernia", "Ireland, Republic of", "ie", "ireland", "🇮🇪", "Eire", "Southern Ireland"], "correct": 1}

{"id": 616, "query": "In what country is Ba Thín River?", "response": " The Batang Ai Dam, which impounds the Batang Ai Reservoir (commonly referred to as \"Ba\" in the local Malay language), can be found in Malaysia. This hydropower project was built between 1986 and 1992 on the Batang Ai River in central Sarawak, a state located on the island of Borneo.\n\nThe Batang Ai River originates in the heights of the Baram Range mountains in the state of Sarawak. The river flows to the south for approximately 70 km until it reaches its confluence with Sungai Murum, forming the Batang Ai Reservoir.\n\nWhen the dam was constructed, a total of 12 villages and their inhabitants were relocated due to the flooding of areas inhabited by native Dayak communities who relied on these lands for agriculture and fishing activities. The resettlement process led to tensions between the indigenous people and the project's developers; however, it also resulted in some improvements in infrastructure and living conditions within the affected settlements.\n\nThe reservoir covers an area of 26 sq km with a storage capacity of approximately 107 million cubic meters when full. It is managed by the Sarawak Energy Berhad (SEB), which serves as both an electricity generator for Malaysia's energy grid and a source of freshwater supply to the region.\n\nThe Batang Ai Dam has contributed significantly to the development and progress of central Sarawak, providing local communities with improved infrastructure such as better roads, schools, health care facilities, and other amenities while also offering opportunities for sustainable economic activities, like agriculture, livestock farming, and ecotourism. However, its establishment required a significant sacrifice from indigenous populations who were displaced to make way for the project's development.", "answer": ["Vietnam", "Socialist Republic of Vietnam", "VN", "VIE", "🇻🇳", "Việt Nam", "Viet Nam", "SRV", "VNM"], "correct": 0}

It is located approximately 20 kilometers north of Massawa, the country's main port city. The total area covered by Tegher and its surrounding villages is roughly 18 square kilometers (6.97 square miles), with a population density of about 43 persons per square kilometer in 2015. The village itself has an altitude ranging from around sea level to approximately 40 meters above it, while the higher ground reaches up to 200 meters above mean sea level.\n\nThe history of Tegher dates back thousands of years and is closely connected with the ancient civilization that inhabited this region. Today, Tegher village primarily consists of a collection of houses built in an area characterized by its undulating terrain, rocky cliffs, and narrow coastal valleys. The main occupation for most people living here is fishing; they rely on both traditional methods like hook-and-line fishing or netting, as well as modern technologies to capture their catch.\n\nAgriculture has also been practiced historically in Tegher village with limited success due to the arid nature of its surrounding lands and harsh climatic conditions that can lead to water scarcity during certain times throughout the year. However, despite these challenges, residents maintain a variety of food crops such as vegetables like onions, garlic or potatoes; fruits including oranges, lemons, olives, figs, pomegranates, grapes, apples, carobs – all grown using local agricultural methods passed down from generation to generation over centuries.\n\nTegher's location in Eritrea also places it near several other significant historical sites like the ancient city of Adulis which dates back more than two millennia ago; however currently remains underwater due to rising sea levels since its abandonment around 1st century AD. The site has shown promising potential for future archaeological research, as evidence indicates that trade in luxury items occurred here between Africa's east coast communities and those across the Red Sea from Arabia/Yemen during Roman times.\n\nIn summary, Tegher village is an integral part of Eritrea’s history with deep-rooted cultural connections to ancient civilizations that once thrived on these lands – even despite challenges posed by its arid climate & limited agricultural success; its residents continue practicing age-old methods passed down through generations while adapting modern fishing technologies alongside agriculture techniques.", "answer": ["Armenia", "Republic of Armenia", "🇦🇲", "ARM", "AM"], "correct": 0}

It is situated approximately 9 kilometers (5.6 miles) southeast of Bad Homburg vor der Höhe and roughly 20 kilometers east-northeast of Frankfurt am Main, the largest city in the region.\n\nReichsberg has a rich history dating back to Roman times when it served as a watchtower for the empire's northern frontier. The mountain was later used by medieval noble families for hunting purposes and as a symbol of their power and status within society. In 1870, after German unification under Otto von Bismarck, Reichsberg became an important location in the newly formed country.\n\nToday, the site is home to numerous cultural landmarks and historical sites connected with Kaiser Wilhelm II's reign:\n\n1. Castle of Kyffhäuser: This was a significant gathering point for Adolf Hitler's supporters during World War II as it featured a memorial dedicated to Frederick Barbarossa (a medieval Holy Roman Emperor) that included a statue known as the \"Throne of Imperialism.\" The castle is situated in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, about 240 kilometers northeast of Reichsberg.\n\n2. Kaiser Wilhelm Monument: This monument was erected on Reichsberg to honor Kaiser Wilhelm II for his military achievements and strong leadership during World War I. It has a commanding view of the surrounding landscape due to its location atop Reichsberg's mountaintop, which makes it an important landmark in German history.\n\n3. Reichsburg Castle: Although not directly related to Reichsberg itself, this 12th-century castle was once a seat for powerful nobles and later transformed into an artillery fortification during World War II when it served as part of the Atlantic Wall defense system. The site is located in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate approximately 50 kilometers east of Frankfurt am Main.\n\nIn conclusion, Reichsberg is situated within the Taunus mountains in Germany and has a rich history that dates back to ancient times when it served as a watchtower for Roman legions, then evolved into an area favored by noble families seeking privacy during hunting trips or political meetings among peers who would later form alliances based on shared interests.

{"id": 653, "query": "In what country is Deodara?", "response": " Deodar (Cedrus deodara) is native to the Himalayas. This tree species can be found in Nepal, northern India, Bhutan and Pakistan. Its natural habitat includes high altitude coniferous forests where it occurs at elevations ranging from 300m to more than 4572m above sea level.\n\nDeodar trees are particularly known for their columnar trunks with blue-grey bark that flakes off as they mature, revealing a smooth reddish brown inner layer. They can grow up to 60 meters in height and have needle-like leaves that range from dark green during the warmer months to silvery grey under winter conditions. The needles of Deodar trees are short and twisted, usually around an inch long with two white stripes on their undersides.\n\nThese evergreen conifers produce male and female cones at separate times of year: male cones typically appearing first followed by females later in summer or early fall when seeds can be released from the female cones. However, due to its slow growth rate Deodara trees have limited reproductive potential which is another reason for their rarity outside their natural habitat areas.\n\nIn addition to providing shade and beauty in landscapes across regions like Europe where it has been introduced as an ornamental plant; these majestic giants serve practical purposes too – from being used for timber production because of its decay-resistant nature plus resistance against termites which makes them long lasting when utilized as building materials such as beams or rafters.\n\nDespite being a sought after tree species due to its aesthetic appeal and usefulness, Deodar trees are facing threats in their natural habitat including deforestation driven by human activities like logging for timber production & urbanization. These factors have contributed towards the reduced population size of this rare conifer; leading conservation efforts around preservation plans which aim at preserving these magnificent giants' existence within limited pockets of their Himalayan range.", "answer": ["India", "Bharat", "Hindustan", "Bharatvarsh", "in", "IN", "Republic of India", "🇮🇳", "IND", "Aryavratt"], "correct": 1}

It is located near the eastern border of the state and serves as an administrative center for the surrounding area. The name \"Iron River\" refers to its location along the banks of the Iron River, which flows into Lake Superior at this point.\n\nThe area around Iron River has a rich history dating back thousands of years, with indigenous peoples such as the Ojibwe and Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) tribes living in the region before European settlers arrived. The early 19th century saw an influx of fur traders, trappers, and other adventurers looking to take advantage of the vast natural resources available in the area, including iron ore deposits which gave the town its name.\n\nOver time, these mineral riches fueled industrial development throughout northern Wisconsin, with Iron River becoming a hub for mining operations that extracted iron from local ore bodies. During the 20th century, various companies operated mines around Iron River and nearby areas, such as Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., which still controls much of the region's industry today.\n\nToday, while some industries have shifted away from traditional extractive methods in favor of more sustainable practices like ecotourism or agricultural uses for land previously used by mining operations; Iron River remains an important center within Bayfield County and beyond it with its role as a service hub providing essential resources such as food stores, medical care facilities along with other retail outlets catering to residents living throughout northwestern Wisconsin.\nIn conclusion: Iron River (CDP), located in northern Wisconsin near Lake Superior's eastern shoreline has deep historical roots dating back thousands of years when indigenous populations first settled here before being followed by European settlers who established industry based on its rich iron deposits – contributing significantly towards America's early industrial development while continuing to serve as an essential service center within Bayfield County today.", "answer": ["United States of America", "the United States of America", "America", "U.S.A.", "USA", "U.S.", "US", "the US", "the USA", "US of A", "the United States", "U.

{"id": 1172, "query": "Who is the author of Bed?", "response": " The exact identity of the author who wrote \"Bed\" remains unclear. There are several possible sources and authors for this phrase, but it's important to note that attribution can be a matter of debate and interpretation. \n\nOne theory suggests that the line might have originated from the song titled \"I Love You, Little One,\" which is attributed to Joe Raposo, an American composer, lyricist, and musician who worked for many years at the children's television show Sesame Street. The song features a verse that goes: \n\n\"I love you little one, in your bed you lay down.\"\n\nHowever, it should be noted that this line is not found in the original version of the song but appears to have been added by another writer or performer over time (if indeed it can be attributed to Raposo at all). \n\nAnother theory suggests that \"Bed\" might come from a nursery rhyme called \"There Was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe.\" The verse goes:\n\n\"She had so many children, she didn't know what to do; She gave them some broth without any bread; Then drew her sword and killed them all. 'Twas the old woman's turn to dine, E-uugh! So she brought them out of the bed.\" \n\nBut it is important to note that not every person agrees on this attribution either. It may be worth noting that different sources attribute slightly varied versions of \"Bed\" or related lines.\n\nLastly, some have also suggested that \"bed\" in a more general sense can be traced back to Old English and Germanic roots where it means 'to lay' or 'lie down'. In modern usage, ‘bed’ could just as easily refer to the act of lying down rather than an actual physical bed. Therefore, depending on context, one might say \"I love you little one; in your sleep you lay down\" - which is quite different from Joe Raposo's version but still technically accurate.\n\nIn summary, while there are multiple theories and sources, the authorship of this line remains debated. It could be attributed to a song by Joe Raposo or to a nursery rhyme like \"There Was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe,\" but without more concrete evidence, it's difficult to say for certain who wrote 'Bed.'", "answer": ["Tao Lin"], "correct": 0}

The protagonist, Hildegarde, is an attractive young woman who becomes ensnared by the enigmatic magician Dr. Hoffman in his quest for power over others through his invention—the Desire Machines. These machines allow users to experience their deepest fantasies and desires in reality; however, they often lead to dangerous consequences as people become trapped within their own minds.\n\nHildegarde's story unfolds with a series of interconnected episodes that weave together the various tales and characters encountered throughout her journey.

Her characters are often outsiders or misfits, reflecting themes found in many of her other works. In addition to fairy tales and folklore, Carter also drew inspiration from literature—particularly Victorian novels—to create her own unique fictional universe.\n\n\"Carnival of Souls\" is an enduring testament to Angela Carter's remarkable imagination and talent as a writer.

{"id": 1365, "query": "Who is the author of Suicide?", "response": " The authorship of \"Suicide\" has been a subject of debate among scholars and literary critics. Although many believe that it was written by Lord Byron, there are those who dispute this claim. Here's some information to consider about the authorship of the poem \"Suicide\":\n\n1. Authorship Attribution: Many people have attributed \"Suicide,\" or at least portions of it, to Byron based on similarities in style and content. However, a close examination of the language used in the poem reveals striking parallels with other works that were believed to be written by Percy Bysshe Shelley (another famous Romantic poet).\n2. The Authorship Controversy: Some scholars argue that \"Suicide\" is more closely related to Shelley's work than Byron’s, and they have identified stylistic similarities between the poem and several of Shelley's other works. They also point out inconsistencies in Byron’s life around 1821-22 when he was believed to be writing \"Childe Harold,\" a popular narrative poem, which makes it hard for some scholars to believe that Byron would take time away from his monumental work to write such an obscure and controversial poem like \"Suicide.\"\n3. Other Possible Authors: There are several other candidates who could have written the poem – or parts of it at least. George Gordon Lord Byron (1788-1824), Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792 - 1822) and John William Polidori (1795 - 1821) all lived during this period, and could potentially have been responsible for the work.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Suicide\" is a controversial piece of literature which has led to much speculation about its authorship. While it's impossible to give an definitive answer as to who wrote it due to various factors including the ambiguity in language use that can be found across different Romantic poets at this time period; however, based on available evidence from scholars and critics alike – Byron is among those considered likely candidates for authoring \"Suicide.\" Ultimately only someone intimately familiar with each individual's style would be able to conclusively determine its true origins.", "answer": ["Viktor Suvorov"], "correct": 0}

In this volume, the author delves deeper into the complexities of human relationships, memory, and time. \"Witt\" is also included in this collection as a standalone story, but there might be other stories with the same title present in either or both collections.\n\nAs for Lydia Davis' background: she was born on January 19, 1947, in New York City and has been widely recognized for her contributions to literature as an American short-story writer, translator, and essayist.
