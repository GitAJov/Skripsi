{"id": 0, "query": "In which city was the pinball machine invented?", "response": " The pinball machine, a popular arcade game that has been captivating players for over a century, was invented in Brooklyn, New York. Louis Maehr and Jerry Paiciani developed the first modern pinball machine named \"Baffle Ball\" at their workshop located at 25 Meserole Street in 1931.\n\nPinball machines have undergone numerous changes throughout history, incorporating different themes and playing styles. However, its origin can be traced back to early coin-operated machines that were inspired by the concept of bagatelle, a pre-existing Italian game involving a metal pin on which wooden balls are made to bounce.\n\nIn Brooklyn, Pinball Wizard Devices began manufacturing pinball machines for various locations like amusement arcades and bars in 1932. The company was run by Harry Mabs and Edward Fredericks who had previously worked at the Baffle Ball workshop during its creation phase. Their first notable machine was called \"H identificación\".\n\nAfter the invention of pinball machines, several other companies began producing their own versions with unique features and styles. Many successful pinball manufacturers such as Williams Electronics, Gottlieb, and Bally developed popular games that continued to be played in arcades all over the world. These included legendary titles like \"The Addams Family,\" \"Star Trek: The Next Generation,\" and others which brought in high revenues for the arcade owners while providing hours of entertainment for the players.\n\nIn addition to being a significant contributor to the history of gaming, pinball machines have also made an impact on popular culture through movies such as “The King of Kong” and television shows like HBO's “Silicon Valley,\" where they are depicted as iconic symbols that evoke nostalgia and fond memories for many.\n\nDespite facing various challenges throughout its long-spanning history, including the rise of video games in the late 1970s and early 80s which resulted in a decline in pinball machine popularity, modern technology has seen an resurgence of interest in these classic machines with numerous pinball manufacturers creating new versions that incorporate advanced features such as LED lighting and high-definition screens.\n\nSo while the exact birthplace of pinball may be debated by some enthusiasts – considering its European origins – it is undeniable that Brooklyn, New York holds a special place in gaming history for introducing this beloved arcade classic to an unsuspecting public back in 1931.", "answer": ["Chi-Beria", "Sayre language academy", "Chicago", "Chicago, Illinois", "Hog Butcher for the World", "Land of smelly onions", "Ariel Community Academy", "The weather in Chicago", "Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.", "Chicago, Illionis", "Near North Montessori", "Religion in Chicago", "Chicago Finance Committee", "The Paris of America", "The city of Chicago", "City of Chicago", "List of sister cities of Chicago", "UN/LOCODE:USCHI", "Chicago theatre scene", "Chicago, WI", "The City of Broad Shoulders", "City of Broad Shoulders", "Sister Cities of Chicago", "Chicago il", "Chicago, Illinois, USA", "Performing arts in Chicago", "Chicago Transportation Committee", "Chicago, Wisconsin", "City of chicago", "Chicago theater scene", "Chicago, Il", "Chicago, IL.", "Chicago, Ill.", "City of Chicago, Illinois", "Chi town", "Chicago, United States", "Chicago (Ill.)", "Transport in Chicago", "Chicago, Illinois, United States", "Chicago (IL)", "USCHI", "Chichago", "Chcago", "Chicago, Illinois, U.S.", "Sister Cities Chicago", "Chicago, USA", "Chi City", "Chicago, IL", "Chi-Town", "Chicago theatre", "Paris of America", "Chicago, Illinois, US", "Chicago Illinois", "The city of Chicago, Illinois", "Sister cities of Chicago"], "correct": 0}
{"id": 1, "query": "The flavoured fishing bait boilie is mainly used to catch which type of fish?", "response": " Flavourful fishing baits, or \"boilies,\" are versatile and can be effective in catching a variety of freshwater fish species. However, their primary target depends on the specific type of boilie you're using, as manufacturers often create them with various ingredients and additives to attract different types of fish. In this response, I will outline some common bait options that anglers use for targeting specific fish species:\n\n1. Carp-specific boilies: These are designed to attract carp, which can be found in lakes, ponds, rivers, and canals throughout the world. They typically contain ingredients such as ground maize, wheat, or fishmeal and come in a variety of shapes (e.g., pellets, circular cakes), sizes, and flavors.\n2. Predator boilies: Anglers often use these baits to target predatory fish like pike, perch, and zander. They are typically made from animal-based protein sources, such as groundfish or chicken breast meat, mixed with a binding agent (e.g., cornflour) and flavorings.\n3. Trout boilies: These can be used to attract rainbow trout and other freshwater fish found in rivers, streams, and lakes. They are generally made from natural ingredients like animal proteins, cornmeal, and additional flavors that appeal to the targeted species. Some baits may also contain additives for color or scent attraction.\n4. Baitfish boilies: These imitation baitfish have a higher protein content than other types of boilies, making them more attractive to predatory fish such as pike and perch. They are often made with ingredients like fishmeal or prawns/shrimp to create an enticing aroma and flavor for target species.\n5. Hybrid boilies: Some anglers may use hybrid baits that can be effective across multiple fish species, depending on the recipe and added attractants. These types of boilies provide a balance between attraction and durability in different water conditions and offer versatility when targeting various freshwater fish species.\n6. Coarse fishing bait boilies: Finally, coarse fishing boilies are designed to target all kinds of coarse fish like carp, tench, bream, rudd, roach, perch, pike, eel, and even some predator species such as chub, barbel, and ide. These baits cater to a wide range of freshwater fish found in rivers, canals, lakes, reservoirs, and ponds and are typically made with ingredients like cornmeal or particles mixed with animal proteins (e.g., groundfish) for enhanced attractiveness.\n\nIn summary, flavored fishing bait boilies can be used to catch various types of fish across the globe, depending on their specific formulation and purpose. It's essential to choose a bait that suits your target species and fishery conditions to maximize success rates.", "answer": ["Aquaculture of carp", "Fishing for carp", "Carps", "Carp", "River Carp"], "correct": 1}
{"id": 2, "query": "\"What was the preoccupation of John Nash Jr, the subject of the 2001 film \"\"A Beautiful Mind\"\" starring Russell Crowe?\"", "response": " The subject of the 2001 film \"A Beautiful Mind,\" starring Russell Crowe, is indeed John Forbes Nash Jr. He was an American mathematician who made significant contributions to the field of game theory and differential geometry. His life story captivated audiences in both the book (published as \"A Beautiful Mind\" by Sylvia Nasar) that preceded the movie, and on screen in Ron Howard's film adaptation.\n\nJohn Nash Jr.'s preoccupation was primarily focused on non-cooperative games, which are a type of mathematical model used to analyze conflict situations where no cooperation is possible or expected between the parties involved. This includes extensive work he conducted on partial differential equations and their role within economics. His most notable contribution in this field is known as Nash equilibrium, wherein both parties in a game do not have an incentive to change their strategy given the strategies of others.\n\nHowever, his life was marred by struggles with severe mental illness, specifically paranoid schizophrenia. The film adaptation depicted these challenges through Russell Crowe's portrayal of John Nash and his journey towards recovery, as well as his academic accomplishments in game theory. This part of the story is based on Sylvia Nasar's biography, which describes how he fought against societal stigmas, fought for institutionalization, and eventually found a way to manage his condition effectively with medication and therapy.\n\nIn addition to his work in mathematics, John Nash Jr. was also an influential educator who taught at several prestigious universities throughout his career, including Princeton University where the film is partially set. His legacy continues through the John F. Kennedy Center for Learning and the John Nash Foundation, both of which aim to promote understanding and awareness about mental illness and its impact on individuals' lives.", "answer": ["Response probability", "Economic theories", "IG(X-M)", "Modern economics", "Economic theory", "Binary Economics", "Econs.", "Economics subdisciplines", "Economic Policy Advisory Board", "Economic pattern", "History of modern economics", "Œconomics", "Economics theory", "LIABILITIES", "Economic doctrine", "Economic sciences", "Modern Economics", "Real Economy", "Bachelor in Economics", "Economic Science", "Fundamentals of economics", "Econs", "Commodity production", "Economic environment", "School of Economics and Business Administration", "Folk Economics", "Liabilities (accounting)", "Economically efficient", "Ecomonic", "Economic inefficiencies", "Economics", "Economic Sciences", "Total liabilities", "Oeconomics", "Economic science", "IGX-M", "Ecomonics", "Economically", "Economics school", "Economiks", "Efficiency (economics)", "Oecononomics", "EconomicS", "Market efficiency", "Economic inefficiency", "Econ.", "Economic activities", "Economic activity"], "correct": 1}

Some accounts suggest that he might have had dual citizenship since both of his parents were Scottish but born in Ireland. In addition to this, Kidd spent much of his adult life in New York, which was then a British colony.\n\nAccording to the most popular version of his biography, William Kidd hailed from Dundee and later moved to Greenock as an apprentice. He sailed for several years on merchant vessels before joining the Royal Navy. After experiencing some successes, he left the navy with the rank of lieutenant in 1689. Following a series of unfortunate business dealings, Kidd found himself in financial trouble by 1695, which led him to become involved with privateering and piracy.\n\nIn June 1696, Kidd was commissioned as an officer under the British East India Company (BEIC) after providing his own ship, the Adventure Galley. His mission: to capture French ships in the Indian Ocean that were aiding their enemy, France. However, despite some success, Kidd began diverting funds from captured goods for himself and allegedly abandoned his duties.\n\nIn 1698, Kidd was recalled by BEIC officials who accused him of failing to meet his objectives. He returned to New York in May 1699 with only a small portion of the expected French prizes, which left him deeply in debt and further under suspicion for engaging in piracy himself.\n\nIn September 1699, Kidd set sail from Boston on the Adventure Galley, hoping to clear his name by capturing pirates off the coast of Madagascar (where he claimed he planned to turn in any captured pirates) or seeking sunken treasure as some speculated was hidden somewhere along the eastern seaboard of America.\n\nInstead, upon returning to New York harbor in June 1700, Kidd found himself under arrest for piracy by a band of disgruntled merchants led by Captain John Fields. They accused him not only of being a pirate but also of murder and robbery during his prior sea voyages. He was subsequently taken to England and charged with piracy.\n\nOn May 23, 1701, Kidd was found guilty and sentenced to hang for the charges laid against him. Although he initially claimed that he had captured French ships while serving under BEIC, he later admitted to some of his pirate activities before being executed on May 23, 1701. His body was then displayed at the Tower of London as a warning to other potential pirates.\n\nIn conclusion, considering Kidd's Scottish roots and his involvement with the British East India Company in piracy, it can be argued that he had dual nationality - belonging partially to Scotland and partially to Britain. It is important to note that during this time period, national borders were less clearly defined than they are today; thus, some ambiguity may surround Kidd's identity.", "answer": ["Scottish (disambiguation)", "Scotish", "Scottish"], "correct": 1}

{"id": 22, "query": "\"\"\"It's still the same old story, the fight for love and glory\"\" are lines from the theme song for which film?\"", "response": " The line \"it's still the same old story\" is a reference to the 1939 American epic historical romance film titled \"The Story of Vernon and Irene Dunne,\" also known as \"Love Affair.\" This romantic drama was directed by Alexander Korda and produced by his brother Zoltan Korda. The screenplay was written by Norman Krasna, who received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay for the movie.\n\n\"The Story of Vernon and Irene Dunne,\" also known as \"Love Affair,\" is a romantic story about two couples that intertwine throughout their lives - one couple in love (Vernon and Irene), and another pair who are still falling in love (\"The Love Affair\"). The film follows the journey of these characters across different time periods, exploring themes such as fate, destiny, love, and commitment.\n\nThe musical score for \"Love Affair\" was composed by Max Steiner, a renowned Austrian-American composer known for his work on classic films like \"King Kong,\" \"Casablanca,\" and \"Gone with the Wind.\" The theme song of this film captures its essence perfectly, as it expresses the eternal nature of love in all its forms.\n\nThe main stars of \"Love Affair\" were Irene Dunne (as Irene Leach) and Charles Boyer (as Tony Johnson), who portrayed the two couples mentioned above. Additional notable cast members included Billрилл и Грэйси Адамс, Джейн Рисдон, и Чарльз Рагглз.\n\nThe film was a commercial success upon its release in 1939, and it received positive reviews from critics for both the performances of Dunne and Boyer as well as Steiner's music score. It also managed to receive several nominations at major awards ceremonies such as Oscars and Golden Globes. However, \"Love Affair\" holds a special place in film history not only due to its success but because it inspired another romantic drama released more than two decades later titled \"An Affair to Remember,\" which starred Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. Both films share many similarities in their plotlines, and the theme song of \"The Story of Vernon and Irene Dunne\" is an integral part of that legacy.", "answer": ["Dar el Beïda, Morocco", "Casablanca (wilaya)", "Wilaya of Casablanca", "الدار البيضاء", "Dar El Beïda, Morocco", "Casa Blanca", "Casablanca-Anfa Prefecture", "Dar-el-Beida (Morocco)", "Casablanca, Morrocco", "Casablanca (city)", "Dar-el-Beida, Morocco", "Casablanco, MO", "Prefecture of Casablanca", "Casablanca, Morocco", "Casablanca, MO", "Dar el Beïda (Morocco)", "Ad-Dār al-Bayḍā", "Wilaya of Dar el Beïda", "Casablanca", "Dar El Beïda (Morocco)", "Prefecture of Dar el Beïda", "Dar Al-Baida", "Ad-Dār al-Bayḍāʼ"], "correct": 1}

The character was none other than Postman Pat, who first appeared in a children's book written by Todd back in 1981 called \"Hello, Little Friend!\" This book depicted the life and adventures of an ordinary postman living in the rural town of Greendale.\n\nTodd wrote several books featuring Postman Pat, each focusing on different aspects of his life as he delivered mail to people throughout the community. The stories were simple but endearing, highlighting Postman Pat's kindness and sense of adventure. These early works laid the groundwork for a series that would captivate generations of viewers across multiple media platforms over the following decades.\n\nIn 1981, the first edition of \"Hello, Little Friend!\" was published, which introduced readers to Postman Pat as they followed his daily adventures in Greendale and how he navigated challenges with a positive attitude. The character's success led Barbara Euphan Todd to write several more stories, including additional adventures for Postman Pat, who became an instant hit amongst children across the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 1981, John Godber adapted \"Hello, Little Friend!\" into a stage play which premiered at the Library Theatre in Sheffield. The success of this production prompted further adaptations of Todd's stories as well as new material based on Postman Pat's adventures for television and radio broadcasts. Over time, these adaptations helped establish Postman Pat as one of Britain's most iconic fictional characters.\n\nIn 1981, the first animated series about Postman Pat aired on BBC One in the UK, titled \"Postman Pat.\" It was created by John Cuniberti and Oliver Postgate, with Barbara Euphan Todd serving as a consultant for continuity purposes during its development stage. The success of this show led to many more adaptations, including movies, TV specials, and even feature films like \"Postman Pat: The Movie\" in 2014 which starred Stephen Mangan as the voice of Postman Pat.\n\nToday, over three decades after Barbara Euphan Todd first introduced readers to Postman Pat through her children's books, the character remains a beloved figure on both television and radio across Britain and beyond.

{"id": 42, "query": "A German naturalist and artist, working latterly in the Netherlands, creating seminal paintings of flora and fauna including the full cycle of an insect in its plant and other context, was who?", "response": " This German naturalist and artist is likely to be Maria Sibylla Merian. Born on April 2nd, 1647 in Frankfurt am Main, she had a profound influence on the field of science illustration and contributed significantly to our understanding of insect metamorphosis. She spent time studying insects and their life cycles, which later formed the basis for her groundbreaking work \"Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamensium\" (1705). Merian was an exceptional artist who depicted flora and fauna through detailed illustrations in the most precise manner possible at that time - often spending months on a single drawing. The full cycle of insects as seen through her works is truly remarkable, showcasing the beauty of nature. Maria Sibylla Merian's work continues to be celebrated today for its accuracy and artistic prowess.\n\nMaria Sibylla Merian spent some time in Amsterdam before moving to Suriname in 1699 where she continued to study insects and their life cycles. She was a trailblazer who defied the norms of her time by focusing on scientific illustration over other genres such as landscape or portraiture. Her work laid the groundwork for future entomologists and illustrators, inspiring generations to come.\n\nMaria Sibylla Merian passed away in 1717 in Amsterdam. Despite living during a period when women were expected to focus solely on household duties rather than science, she defied convention through her dedication to both art and scientific pursuit. Maria Sibylla Merian's contributions continue to be recognized and celebrated as an example of the power of determination and passion in the face of adversity.", "answer": ["Maria Sybilla Merian (1647-1717)"], "correct": 0}
