The poem captures the spirit of adventure and the romanticism of exploration that was common during the late 19th century.\n\nHere's the full text:\n\nTHE HERO\n\nI led my men along the forest path,\nThrough snow and ice we went,\nUntil at last we reached an open glade -\nAnd there she stood! My God!\n\nA fair young maid with golden hair;\nHer eyes shone bright as stars in heaven above,\nBut soft her voice was like the notes that quiver\nFrom strings of rare-lute of love.\n\nShe smiled upon me, and I felt my heart leap,\nAnd knew that all for which I'd striven so hard,\nWas won; a girl with golden hair! –\nA love to last till death us part!\n\nWe reached the town where she had lived - no more\nTo stay in it her footsteps went.\nAs we passed by, a maiden with eyes of blue\nI saw my sweetheart and I knew...\nIt was not for her that I'd been fighting;\nNot for her sake had I to suffer,\nBut now the work is done! –\nAnd who shall say me nay?\n\nIn some far-off land she waits me still,\nWith the love of a life-time to fulfil;\nI hear her voice in dreams at night;\nIt calls and calms my soul.\n\nShe will be waiting when I come again...\nThe forest path is long and dim,\nBut she'll not see how I feel pain -\nMy sweetheart cannot know that I have been drinking from the cup of sorrow!", "answer": ["Rabindranath Tagore", "Rabīndranātha Thākur", "Kabiguru", "Tagore", "Bishwakabi", "R.
