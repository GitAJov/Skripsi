through nonhuman cells at a subphysiological temperature, which produces spontaneous mutations in the viral genome. oral polio vaccines were developed by several groups, one of which was led by albert sabin. other groups, led by hilary koprowski and h.r. cox, developed their own attenuated vaccine strains. in 1958, the national institutes of health created a special committee on live polio vaccines. the various vaccines were carefully evaluated for their ability to induce immunity to polio, while retaining a low incidence of neuropathogenicity in monkeys. large-scale clinical trials performed in the soviet union in late 1950s to early 1960s by mikhail chumakov and his colleagues demonstrated safety and high efficacy of the vaccine. based on these results, the sabin strains were chosen for worldwide distribution. fifty-seven nucleotide substitutions distinguish the attenuated sabin 1 strain from its virulent parent (the mahoney serotype), two nucleotide substitutions attenuate the sabin 2 strain, and 10 substitutions are involved in attenuating the sabin 3 strain. the primary attenuating factor common to all three sabin vaccines is a mutation located in the virus's internal ribosome entry site, which alters stem-loop structures and reduces the ability of poliovirus to translate its rna template within the host cell. the attenuated poliovirus in the sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of infection and replication, but is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue. in 1961, type 1 and 2 monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine (mopv) was licensed, and in 1962, type 3 mopv was licensed. in 1963, trivalent opv (topv) was licensed, and became the vaccine of choice in the united states and most other countries of the world, largely replacing the inactivated polio vaccine. a second wave of mass immunizations led to a further dramatic decline in the number of polio cases. between 1962 and 1965, about 100 million americans (roughly 56% of the population at that time) received the sabin vaccine. the result was a substantial reduction in the number of poliomyelitis cases, even from the much-reduced levels following the introduction of the salk vaccine.\nStep 6: Evaluating utility for response 4...\nUtility score: 5\nSelecting the best response...\nBest response support: the sabin vaccine, developed by albert sabin, was created to combat the viral infectious disease known as polio (poliomyelitis). this oral vaccine uses an attenuated form of the virus, which produces immunity in individuals without causing severe illness or paralysis. opv is an attenuated vaccine, produced by the passage of the virus through nonhuman cells at a subphysiological temperature, which produces spontaneous mutations in the viral genome. oral polio vaccines were developed by several groups, one of which was led by albert sabin. other groups, led by hilary koprowski and h.r. cox, developed their own attenuated vaccine strains. in 1958, the national institutes of health created a special committee on live polio vaccines. the various vaccines were carefully evaluated for their ability to
